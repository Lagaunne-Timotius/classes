\begin_layout Abstract
In this project, several methods were used to classify pixels in a hyperspectral
 data set taken from Indian Pines.
 In general, the data was first decomposed using one of the dimensionality
 reduction techniques discussed and a classification algorithm was applied
 to the remaining dimensions.
 Several different approaches to dimensionality reduction and classification
 were used and the results of these experiments were computed using the
 Rand Index on the classified image compared with the ground truth provided.
 First, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the entire
 image preserving the 8 most varied bands.
 Next, a Local PCA was performed using local regions in the image.
 After this, PCA was similarly performed using local bands in the image.
 Finally, these two methods of Local and Split Band PCA were combined.
 Several classification algorithms were then performed on each of these
 datasets.
 In the end, it was found that the best result came from combining GMM,
 K-Means, and LDA methods with voting to achieve a Rand Index of 88%.
 There were also a number of failed experiments for dimensionality reduction,
 using KPCA and Laplacian Eigenmaps, that may be worthy of further study.

\begin_layout Standard
The precise classification of remote sensing images has numerous real time
 applications such as environmental monitoring, plant and mineral exploration.
 The emergence of high resolution sensors and supercomputing devices has
 compelled the use of hyperspectral images for image analysis and classification.
 Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) captures a dense spectral sampling of reflectance
 values over a wide range of spectrum.
 This rich spectral information in every spatial location increases the
 capability to distinguish different physical structures, leading to the
 potential of a more precise image classification.
 However, they suffer from the dimensionality of the data.
 Hence, we use a two stage approach, dimensionality reduction and unsupervised
 classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the paper will be divided into sections discussing the implementatio
n, experiments and corresponding results.
 The dataset used for these experiments is collected by AVIRIS from the
 Indian Pines site in Northwest Indiana.
 It consists of 224 bands from visible to near infrared (400 - 2500 nm).
 A subset of this data was then created by removing the bands covering water
 absorption, leaving 200 bands covering 145 x 145 pixels

Implementation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Implementation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation covers two stages.
 First, the data is subjected to a dimensionality reduction.
 Next, this reduced dataset is processed through a classification algorithm.
 These methods are detailed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dimensionality Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Global PCA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global PCA is the conventional dimensionality reduction.
 Principle Component Analysis is performed on all bands across the entire
 image.
 This should find highly uncorrelated bands across the entire image.
 Global PCA for our experiments was set to return 8 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Localized PCA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A PCA implementation was used to determine bands that had a high covariance
 in specific regions of the image.
 Theoretically, this should preserve the bands that correspond to differences
 in local sections of the image.
 Localized PCA uses the spatial information to first divide the image into
 sections.
 PCA is then performed on each section, preserving 4 bands for each section.
 These bands are then combined for clustering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Split Band PCA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The working theory behind the split band theory of PCA is that bands close
 to one another will be similar.
 With this in mind, there should be a minimal loss of information if we
 perform a component analysis on local clusters of bands.
 So, Split Band PCA takes the bands of the image and divides them up into
 bandwidths to perform PCA upon.
 In the event the number of dimensions is not divisible by the bandwidth,
 the extra bands are distributed evenly to the first chunks of classes one
 by one.
 PCA is then performed on each chunk of bands, transforming the data to
 preserve only the band with the highest covariance.
 For this experiment, the bandwidth used was of size 50, giving a total
 of 4 bands to use for clustering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Local-Split
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Local-Split method simply combines the 4 bands from Local and 4 bands
 from Split and uses the 8 total bands for clustering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
K-Means & C-Means
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The K-Means algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between the points and
 a centroid to determine the class that each point belongs to.
 Each centroid is initialized randomly and pixels are assigned to the closest
 centroid.
 The centers are then recalculated by averaging the points that have been
 assigned to it.
 The process is then repeated until the centroids converge to stable points

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The C-Means algorithm is similar, but instead of giving each pixel a specific
 cluster membership, it assigns each point a membership to all clusters
 based on a slightly modified objective function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pal2005possibilistic"

\end_inset

.
 The assignment of clusters is then the same as for K-Means except the membershi
p values is used as a weight for all points in the average.
 The maximum membership is then used as the class assignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ISODATA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ISODATA algorithm is an extension of the K-Means algorithm.
 It uses the same assignment of clusters and update of centers, however
 it will discard clusters that become to small or split clusters that become
 to large.
 As such, it does not need to be explicitly given a number of clusters to
 create 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ball1965isodata"

\end_inset

.
 For purposes of this implementation, the initial clusters was set to 58
 with a minimum cluster size of 20 pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Latent Dirichlet Allocation a document that has collection of words is
 assumed to be a mixture of topics.
 Specifically, LDA will find the topic mixture in each document and find
 the topic assignment for each words.
  The mixture of topics in each documents is assumed to have Dirichlet prior.
 For image segmentation problems, document can be some superpixel of images
 and the words are the label of pixels that might be constructed with some
 other algorithm (ex.
 K-Means or other clustering algorithms).
 The documents also can be constructed with some other algorithm like normalized
 cut or K-Means .
 Using K-Means, the number of documents used was set to 17 with 100 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gaussian Mixture Models can be used for clustering.
 They assign each point to a multivariate Gaussian distribution such that
 they maximize the probability of belonging to that distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Two Stage Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, a two-stage classification using two different classifiers
 has been proposed.
 The first stage includes an unsupervised classification methods such as
 K-means or C-means which provides initialized labels for next stage.
 In the second stage, using an algorithm to eliminate outliers and given
 labels calculated in the first stage, SVM algorithm has been used to train
 for the inliers.
 Once we trained using inliers, it can be applied to entire data set and
 obtain different classes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two algorithms have been considered to eliminate outliers, the first one
 uses searching window to find data points that have similar neighbor labels
 and by doing that data points that are more consistence and far from class
 boarder have been selected.
 The alternative method which can be only used for C-mean classification
 in first stage uses weights of labels to threshold outliers, that is data
 point that are more likely to represent class characteristics will be selected
 and used to train SVM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Voting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final classification algorithm explored was a voting method on the results
 of the other methods.
 Because the labels from each result image do not necessarily correspond
 to the labels in one another, it is necessary to use an algorithm that
 can handle such situations.
 For this, we implemented the Hungarian method on these results 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ayad2005cluster"

\end_inset

.
 The Hungarian method optimizes the combinations and relabels each image
 so that the labels are now the same as one another.
 The resultant images then vote to produce the final result.
 As implemented, the voting method only votes on images from the GMM, K-Means,
 and LDA algorithms.

\begin_layout Standard
For each dimensionality technique, each clustering algorithm was applied
 and the results can be seen below.
 K-Means, C-Means and LDA algorithms require a random seed to initialize
 the centers.
 For purposes of these experiments, these random seeds are set to 100 for
 K-Means and C-Means; and 1 for LDA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first experiment, each clustering algorithm was used on the Global
 PCA dataset.
 The results can be seen in Table

Along with these experiments, there was also an attempt to use non-linear
 dimensionality techniques, such as Kernel PCA and Laplacian Eigenmaps.
 These gave results much lower than random assignment (~75%) and so were
 not pursued.
 It is possible however, that because these methods require several parameters
 to be set for calculation, they may not have been optimally set.

Conclusion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global PCA easily performed the worst out of all these methods, but it is
 still better than random chance for most clustering methods.
 The best results were obtained by using the Local-Split method of PCA with
 voting applied to the results of LDA, K-Means, and GMM.
 It is worth noting here that though we attempted to use non-linear KPCA
 and Eigenmap reduction techniques, we did not attempt at all to optimize
 the parameters.
 This was largely due to time of computation, and may be a subject to be
 further investigated.
