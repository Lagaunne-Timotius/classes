# Machine-Learning
Self coded machine learning and its helper functions

Currently tools consist of :
  1. Data Partition function that can randomly partition the data into two  
  2. Confussion Matrix that can compare two vectors ( prediction and actual label)
  3. Normalization that can normalized feature matrix based on its max and min of each feature
  4. randindex that compute the rand index of ground truth and clustering result
