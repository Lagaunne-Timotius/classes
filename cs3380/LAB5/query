*/3.3.1 Create a View: Part 1
Create a view that shows the person’s id (pid), first name (fname) and last name (lname) for all people who
have a body weight above 140. This view should be named “weight” (without the quotes). You must use an
INNER JOIN in the views query. Your PHP page should then query the view (i.e. SELECT * FROM weight).
(8 rows)
3.3.2 Create a View: Part 2
Create a view that returns the first name (fname), last name (lname) and BMI for people with a weight
above 150. This view should be named “BMI”. You must use an INNER JOIN and you must reference the
“weight” view created in 3.3.1. BMI is calculated as
703 ·
weight
height2
(1)
In this view, round the BMI value to the nearest whole number. For example, a person with a height of 71
inches and weight of 145 lbs would have a BMI of 20.2 which would be rounded to 20. Use an SQL function
2
to achieve this rounded result. Your PHP page should then query the view (i.e. SELECT * FROM bmi). (12
